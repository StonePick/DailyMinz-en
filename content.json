On the internet, a person exists in the eyes of others merely as a combination of data and self-narrative text. Stripped of their face, people seem to become ‚Äúbolder,‚Äù less concerned with matters of ‚Äúsocial image.‚Äù This has given rise to two contradictory yet coexisting extremes of the internet. On the one hand, there is extreme egalitarianism ‚Äî regardless of age or social status, everyone is freed from the constraints of real-world etiquette. On the other hand, there is a severe lack of respect ‚Äî words are spoken without regard for others‚Äô feelings, and even if no real-life grievances exist, insults and mockery flow freely. Conflicts of thought and ideology are inevitable wherever people gather. While debates do not necessarily (and often will not) lead to consensus or a clear distinction between right and wrong, it remains a fundamental principle for all internet users to engage in discussion with both courtesy and effectiveness. Below, I have summarized some personal strategies to avoid unnecessary quarrels and anger in online debates. Though they are based on my own experiences, I hope they can contribute in some small way to upholding rational discourse and serve as a starting point for further discussion. A! Speak with Kindness Before you dive into the turbulent waters of the comment section, take a moment to temper your fiery enthusiasm or righteous indignation. One unique advantage of online communication is that all ‚Äúspoken expressions‚Äù are inevitably transformed into ‚Äúwritten language,‚Äù turning voices into text. This means that when you present your thoughts to the public, you have more than one chance to reflect, review, and refine your words. Thinking before speaking does not mean weakening your stance or compromising your opinions‚Äîit simply means ensuring that your expression is not driven by aggressive emotions. The true power of language lies in logic and facts. Avoid expressing your viewpoints with hostility or sarcasm. Those who disagree with you are not your enemies. When presenting your views, adopt a tone of humility. Phrases like ‚ÄúI believe‚Ä¶‚Äù or ‚ÄúAs far as I know, I think‚Ä¶ makes more sense‚Äù help maintain a respectful and open discussion. When you show goodwill, even those who wish to challenge you will feel compelled to respond in a serious or courteous manner‚Äîif they do not, they put themselves at a moral disadvantage. Be mindful of your choice of words and tone. Try to convey humor and loveliness in your responses, and make good use of emojis and emoticons. Avoid starting or ending your statements with rhetorical questions. Rhetorical questions at the beginning or conclusion of a discussion can easily come across as sarcastic or condescending, making others perceive an air of superiority in your words. B! Argue with Reason The first and foremost rule is to stick ‚Äúto the topic.‚Äù Always remember that your opponent‚Äôs political stance, beliefs, or personal character are not relevant to the discussion. Bringing them up only reflects poorly on your own manners. When making an argument, do not use opinions to justify opinions. In other words, avoid relying on political theories, moral standards, or ideological beliefs as proof of your correctness. These concepts are not objective facts and therefore cannot serve as valid evidence. While it is understandable to use personal anecdotes in an informal debate setting, this does not mean that authoritative sources and factual accuracy should be disregarded. To prevent your opponent from engaging in ‚Äúselective blindness‚Äù, struggling with basic logical reasoning, or escalating the discussion into unnecessary conflict, presenting your arguments in an ordered list is highly effective. Clearly structuring your questions, objections, viewpoints, and supporting evidence in numbered points forces the other party to think critically and reduces the likelihood of an emotional outburst. A well-organized (1)(2)(3) breakdown leaves no room for deception or evasion. C! Know When to Stop Do not entertain the illusion that you can change someone‚Äôs mind. First, the window for debate on social media is extremely short‚Äîfar too brief for you to systematically gather evidence and dismantle someone‚Äôs beliefs. Second, when a discussion takes a serious turn, not everyone is willing to continue. Most people lack the patience or ability to engage in prolonged discourse. The power of bias is immense. Changing the perspectives of those around you is already an uphill battle‚Äîlet alone convincing complete strangers on the internet. Sometimes, silence is the best way to maintain your own peace of mind. When is it better to walk away from an argument? First, When you realize the other person‚Äôs only goal is to vent their emotions. Second, When you see that their counterarguments rely on labeling or stereotyping you, judging your viewpoint based on unrelated factors such as ideology or character rather than actual reasoning. Third, When you notice severe flaws in their logical reasoning. Always remember: the views you defend are not necessarily the absolute truth. No matter what, maintaining humility and respect should take priority. The ability to advance and retreat is equally crucial‚Äîchoosing silence does not mean yielding to arrogance or ignorance, but rather ensuring that you do not become like them.","categories":[{"name":"Scratchy Sketches","slug":"Scratchy-Sketches","permalink":"https://en.dailyminz.org/categories/Scratchy-Sketches/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Internet","slug":"Internet","permalink":"https://en.dailyminz.org/tags/Internet/"},{"name":"Daily","slug":"Daily","permalink":"https://en.dailyminz.org/tags/Daily/"}]},{"title":"üåêRSS Available Now","slug":"RSS-Available-Now","date":"2024-12-18T16:00:00.000Z","updated":"2025-03-17T07:05:43.746Z","comments":true,"path":"2024/12/19/RSS-Available-Now/","permalink":"https://en.dailyminz.org/2024/12/19/RSS-Available-Now/","excerpt":"RSS Feed function has been available.

If you have no idea what is RSS, there‚Äôs a brief explanation below. RSS, which is the short for Really Simple Syndication. As its name, this technology is used for syndicating the information from websites and pushing the collection to the subscriber, so that the user can surf it in the RSS reader, instead of checking updates of every website on their own. This resembles with the ‚Äúfollow‚Äù function on the content and social websites that as long as you ‚Äúfollow‚Äù websites interested in, the updates will be automatically pushed to your syndicator; however, different from the ‚Äúfollow‚Äù on the content platforms, RSS has capability to fetch updates far more than one or two sources. Reasons for choosing RSS: Saving time of checking updates manually. Beneficial for your concentrating on really valuable information. The categorizing function syndicators provide is helpful of sorting information sources, optimizing your info structure. Syndicators will fetch xml files from targeted links, in which the posts data are storaged. When content of websites is updated, so do the files. RSS has several standards, among which this site employs Atom.","categories":[{"name":"Announcement","slug":"Announcement","permalink":"https://en.dailyminz.org/categories/Announcement/"}],"tags":[]},{"title":"üåêWhy I Open the Blog","slug":"Why-I-Open-the-Blog","date":"2024-11-30T06:02:28.000Z","updated":"2025-03-17T05:45:18.622Z","comments":true,"path":"2024/11/30/Why-I-Open-the-Blog/","permalink":"https://en.dailyminz.org/2024/11/30/Why-I-Open-the-Blog/","excerpt":"I have always wanted to document my thoughts and ideas, but for a long time, various reasons prevented me from doing so.

Original edition shall prevail if divergence exists. Hello World! I have always wanted to document my thoughts and ideas, but for a long time, various reasons prevented me from doing so. Prolonged procrastination made me realize that many of my earlier reflections and ideas have already been lost in the desert of memory, difficult to retrieve. When I finally found a rare moment of respite to pick up the pen I had long set aside, I discovered the poverty of my knowledge and creativity. I realized that my language skills had been eroded by fragmented media, leaving me unable to effectively organize my thoughts and articulate complex feelings. I believe the situation has become urgent. I need to continuously produce content‚Äînot fragmented, pretentious one-liners on various social media platforms, but complete and well-structured articles to document my intellectual journey. Thus, I‚Äôve chosen this form, considered ‚Äúoutdated‚Äù in the modern internet landscape‚Äîa blog‚Äîto take on this task. Unlike most blogs, this one won‚Äôt restrict its focus to computer technology. Instead, it aims to present my personal perspectives within the scope of my knowledge. While an individual‚Äôs knowledge system is inevitably limited, I sincerely invite readers to provide valuable guidance, suggestions, and critiques. On this blog, I will share my knowledge, insights, and thoughts. I hope that through consistent updates, I can motivate myself to remain on the path of lifelong learning. This is also the reason behind the blog‚Äôs name, DailyMinz. If my humble efforts can offer even a small amount of help to others on their journeys, it would be deeply meaningful to me. Roadmap First, I need to address the technical issues of this blog. I‚Äôm still unfamiliar with the Hexo framework and haven‚Äôt decided whether to stick with the current template. Issues like comments and multilingual support are also pressing concerns. Second, there‚Äôs the matter of updating the blog content. But that‚Äôs not a problem‚ÄîI already know what my next post will be about. Lastly, once the blog‚Äôs content becomes more substantial, I might create dedicated sections for specific topics to help maintain updates on those subjects. I might also write things like ‚Äúweekly/monthly reports‚Äù or ‚Äúmonthly/quarterly/annual specials,‚Äù but that‚Äôs something for later.","categories":[{"name":"Announcement","slug":"Announcement","permalink":"https://en.dailyminz.org/categories/Announcement/"}],"tags":[]}],"categories":[{"name":"Scratchy Sketches","slug":"Scratchy-Sketches","permalink":"https://en.dailyminz.org/categories/Scratchy-Sketches/"},{"name":"Announcement","slug":"Announcement","permalink":"https://en.dailyminz.org/categories/Announcement/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Internet","slug":"Internet","permalink":"https://en.dailyminz.org/tags/Internet/"},{"name":"Daily","slug":"Daily","permalink":"https://en.dailyminz.org/tags/Daily/"}]}
