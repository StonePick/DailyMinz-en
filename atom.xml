    <summary type="html">One year ago, this date witnessed the birth of DailyMinz. I hope she can contain my all kinds of ideas and thoughts. Looking back today, this wish comes true smoothly. The problem is no longer nowhere to record and share humble views, but my productivity lagging the update&#39;s shortage. I beware of my shallow knowledge and, in order to sustain output streams, it is necessary to deepen study and training more and more.</summary>

    <summary type="html">The magic of social media lies not only in its ability to connect people across distances but also in its ability to erase them. On the internet, a person exists in the eyes of others merely as a combination of data and self-narrative text.

    <summary type="html">My blog launched on November 30th that has been exactly one month &#39;til now. This very one month is short that if it were not for my blogging, this piece of time would flow away in silence, like those short pieces of time in the past, unaware. However luckily I determined to start a blog and during the past month I didn&#39;t rely on video games as my spiritual drugs. Expedition into the upcoming unknown realms has already taken most of my concentration free to use.</summary>

When I finally found a rare moment of respite to pick up the pen I had long set aside, I discovered the poverty of my knowledge and creativity. I realized that my language skills had been eroded by fragmented media, leaving me unable to effectively organize my thoughts and articulate complex feelings.</summary>
